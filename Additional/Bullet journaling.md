> A **bullet journal** (sometimes known as a **BuJo**) is a method of [personal organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_organizer "Personal organizer") developed by [digital product designer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_product_design "Digital product design") Ryder Carroll.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_journal#cite_note-1)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_journal#cite_note-:3-2)

> The system organizes [scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schedule "Schedule"), reminders, [to-do lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To-do_list "To-do list"), [brainstorming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming "Brainstorming"), and other organizational tasks into a single notebook. The name "bullet journal" comes from the use of abbreviated [bullet points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(typography) "Bullet (typography)") to log information,[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_journal#cite_note-:4-3) but it also partially comes from the use of dot journals, which are gridded using dots rather than lines.[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_journal#cite_note-4) First shared with the public in 2013, it has become a popular organization method, garnering significant attention on [Kickstarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstarter "Kickstarter"), [Instagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram "Instagram"), Facebook, YouTube, and [Pinterest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinterest "Pinterest").[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_journal#cite_note-:1-5)[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_journal#cite_note-:2-6)
