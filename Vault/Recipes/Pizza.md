# About 

This is an easy [[Recipe|recipe]] for making half-decent pizza at home.

---

At some point during the pandemic I found a recipe for making pizzas from scratch, and soon after _Pizza Fridays_ became regular thing at my flat. This lasted for a year or so, until we apparently left the tradition behind, and I forgot the recipe. Luckily, I had written down and shared the recipe with a friend for a pandemic-email-recipe-exchange-campaign, and I could recover it.

I would prepare a few batches of dough in advance -- in the morning, or the previous evening -- which shouldn't take more than 10 minutes, and let it rest until dinner time.
In the evening we would gather to make pizzas together with each assemblying their own pizza, and being responsible for baking it.
It definitely makes for a fun dinner concept that gets everyone engaged in pizza novelty competitions, and the pizza itself is pretty decent for homemade.

# Outline

The general idea is the following:

1.  Prepare the dough in advance, and let it rest to ferment in a cool place (for a few hours), or in the fridge (up to a few days).
2.  Split the dough, open it by hand, and assemble the pizza.
3.  Bake in preheated oven (depending on your over ~15 minutes or to taste)
4.  Add aditional toppings and enjoy.


# Ingredients 

## Dough ingredients 
My recipe follows volume measurements and only requires a 1dl cup.
Kenji's recipe (video linked below) calls for a scale for better precision and for tracking percentages that can be easily scalled for larger batches. His ingredient list includes: 500g of flour; 12.5g salt (2.5%); 2g of instant yeast (0.5%); 5g of sugar (1%); 20g of fat (4%; olive oil or vegetable oil); 300g/ml of water (60% hydration).

Nevertheless, the more sloppy volumetric recipe I follow includes the following:

-   5dl of flour (more or less anything works but italian zero zero flour seems to work better)
-   2dl of lukewarm water
-   3 tablespoons of olive oil
-   1 teaspoon of salt
-   half an envelope of instant yeast (6-7g; make sure your yeast has not been sitting in your pantry for ever)

## Pizza toppings (free-for-all) 

This is the fun part. As long as you are not Italian ou can't really go wrong. Essentials include:

-   Tomato sauce (can of tomato sauce; optionally reduced; or homemade version), or skip for white pizza
-   1 Mozarella per pizza
-   Black pepper (freshly crashed)
-   Topping ideas:
    -   salami, sliced saussage
    -   basil leaves (add _after_ cooking)
    -   proscuto (add _after_ cooking)
    -   additional cheese (e.g. blue cheese, parmigian, etc.)


# Tools 

-   Bowl for mixing flour
-   Parchment paper
-   1dl measuring cup
-   (optional but useful) dough cutter
-   (optional) pizza peel
-   (optional) pizza stone
-   (optional) scale if opting for weight measurements.


# Recipe 

## Prepare the dough 

-   Mix the lukewarm water with the yeast and olive oil, whisking until everythin is mixed. Some chose to start with the yeast and a portion of the water adding sugar to activate the yeast.
-   Mix in a bowl, start with everything but flour and whisk until everything is mixed.
-   Add the flour and knead the dough for a few minutes until it's not sticky.
-   Cover with kitchen towel, and leave for 45 minutes to 6h in a cool place, or in the fridge (1 night to 2 days).
-   After the resting time you should have dough for 2 pizzas.

## Assemble the pizzas and cook 

-   Preheat the oven (180-230 degrees depending on oven and taste). If you have a pizza stone preheat it for 30-45 minutes.
-   Split the dough in 2, and get a parchment paper for each.
-   Dust your working surface with flour.
-   Open the dough, ideally in the air on the back of your hands (you get better at it with time). _Do note use a rolling pin_ as it removes air bubbles.
-   Add toppings:
    -   a few tablespoons of tomato sauce and spread on the dough;
    -   1 mozzarella per pizza (cut in slices or shread by hand);
    -   additional toppings (e.g. sliced mushrooms, salami, blue cheese, etc.);
    -   top with a bit of olive oil and freshly ground pepper.

## Cook pizzas {#cook-pizzas}

-   Place the assembled pizza in the oven and bake to your liking. Depending on the oven, this could take from 15 to 30 minutes.
-   Take out of the oven and add additional toppings (e.g. basil, ruccola, parmigian, proscuto, etc.).
-   enjoy.


# Additional notes & ideas
-   Experiment with different methods for making and fermenting dough. See for example the Pro Home Cooks video below that calls for making a 'poolish' a day ahead).
-   Skip the tomato sauce for a white pizza.
-   Make your own tomato sauce.
-   Instead of making pizza, you can slice the dough to stripes, soak them in a mix of olive, oregano, and pepper to make cracker-sticks, or add cheese for cheese sticks.
