# About

Eggs, for those who eat them, are a great source of protein and many nutrients. And unlike we were told 20 years ago, you cannot easily eat too many.

'Ramen eggs' (or _ajitsuke tamago_ as the internet suggest they are called) might be one of the most practical and tasty ways to compliment dishes with additional protein and neutrients, as well as with flavor and texture. And they also look great.

Perfect with many dishes with legumes, fish, meat, noodles, and of course with ramen.
Make a batch of ramen eggs, say 6 to 8, keep them marinating in the fridge for up to 4-5 days, and try a couple with whichever dish might need a bump.

# Tools

-   cooking pot
-   bowl (with ice/cold water)
-   container for marinating and refrigerating the cooked eggs
- [optional] a couple of pieces of kitchen paper
- [optional] something to prick egg shells before cooking

# Ingredients

- Eggs (I usually do a batch of 8)
- Soy sauce (common soy sauce, or Chinese light soy sauce)
- Dark soy sauce
- Optional marinade ingredients
	- Mirin (Japanese cooking rice wine)
	- Garlic cloves 
	- dry spices 

# Recipe 
## Marinade

Make a mixture of water, a few tablespoons of light soy sauce (usual soy sauce), a few tablespoons of mirin, and a couple of tablespoons of dark soy sauce.
The dark soy sauce will make the outer layer of the egg whites darker, while mirin and the light soy sauce will contribute to the flavor profile of the eggs. Optionally experiment with adding ingredients to the marinade like whole spices and garlic.

## Boiling the eggs

1.  Start with room temperature eggs, or let them come to room temperature.
2.  [optional] prick the bottom of the eggs with a pin to release the trapped air and avoid cracking (tip from Keizo Shimamoto of Ramen Shack);
3.  add water to the pot and bring it to a boil;
4.  add the eggs and start a timer for 6:30-7 minutes (optimize time itteratively according to stove);
5.  drop the eggs in ice water; or cold water that your renew a few times;
6.  when the eggs are cold, crach them on a flat surface and _peel under water_ (which helps removing the egg shell without injuring the fragile eggs);
7.  dip in a tapper with the marinade;
8.  put kitchen paper on top (to avoid white spots because peeled eggs float);
9.  Keep in the fridge for up to 4-5 days.

# Serving 

Carefully cut in half, and garnish with white or black sesame seeds.
Serve over soup or next to
